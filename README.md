# README

This is the [2nd project](https://github.com/aziflaj/52#week-2) for my **52 weeks, 52 projects** challenge. It is the UI of a simple Invoice application, developed with AngularJS and SASS, using Gulp for build automation.

## Run it
To see the application running, you have to firstly install the NPM dependencies, then obtain the Bower libraries and finally start the live-reload server on `http://localhost:8080/`:

```bash
$ npm install     # install NPM dependencies
$ bower install   # obtain Bower libraries
$ gulp            # start the server
```
